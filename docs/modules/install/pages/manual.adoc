= Installing Decidim Environment and a Decidim Instance

*DECIDIM ENVIRONMENT*

In order to implement an instance of Decidim or to make contributions to the base code, you'll need:

* *Ruby* 2.7.5 and *https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv[Rbenv]* for managing various Ruby versions. You could also use https://rvm.io/[rvm] or https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf[asdf] as alternatives to rbenv. Mind that at the moment, Decidim isn't compatible with Ruby 3.0.
* *PostgreSQL* 12.7+ for the database.
* *NodeJS* 16.9.x and Yarn as its package manager.
* *ImageMagick*

For making a production deployment with real users, besides the configuration explained here, you should configure a web server (like nginx), backups, monitoring, etc.

For making contributions to the base code of Decidim as a developer, it is recommended that you also have installed:

* *Git* 2.15+
* *Chrome* browser and https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/[chromedriver].

We recommend to have at least some basic proficiency in Ruby on Rails (a good starting point is http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html[Getting Started with Ruby on Rails]) and have some knowledge on how gems work.

If you have any doubts and you're blocked you can go and ask on https://matrix.to/#/#decidimdevs:matrix.org[our Matrix.org chat room for developers].

This guide covers the installation on an Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS Operating System. However, you're free to use the technology that you are most comfortable with. 


== 1. Installing rbenv

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential curl git libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
rbenv install 2.7.5
rbenv global 2.7.5
----

== 2. Installing PostgreSQL

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install -y postgresql libpq-dev
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER decidim_app WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB NOCREATEROLE PASSWORD 'thepassword'"
----

You need to change the password (in this example is "thepassword") and save it somewhere to configure it later with the application.

== 3. Installing Node.js and Yarn

[source,bash]
----
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/yarnkey.gpg >/dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/yarnkey.gpg] https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y yarn
----

== 4. Installing ImageMagick

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install -y libicu-dev imagemagick
----

*DECIDIM INSTANCE*

Install the `decidim` gem with its dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
gem install decidim
----

Then we can create an application with the `decidim` executable, where `decidim_application` is your application name (ie DecidimBarcelona):

[source,bash]
----
decidim decidim_application
cd decidim_application
----

We recommend that you save it all on Git.

[source,bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit. Generated with Decidim https://decidim.org"
----

*CONFIGURING EVERYTHING TOGETHER*

== 1. Configure the database

Modify your environmental variables (see `config/database.yml`). For this you can use https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro[figaro], https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv[dotenv] or https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars[rbenv-vars]. You
should always be careful of not uploading your plain secrets (environmental variables) on git or your version control system. You can also upload the encrypted secrets, using the sekrets gem or if you're on Ruby on Rails greater than 5.1 you can do it natively.

For a development environment, and if you are using rbenv, we strongly recommend you to use the https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars[rbenv-vars] to facilitate the edition of ENV vars.

First you'll need to install the rbenv-vars plugin:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars.git "$(rbenv root)"/plugins/rbenv-vars
----

Then, in **any folder above your decidim generated application**, you need to create a file named `.rbenv-vars` and put your variables there:

[source,bash]
----
cat << EOF > .rbenv-vars
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_USERNAME=decidim_app
DATABASE_PASSWORD=thepassword
EOF
----

Be careful where you put the `.rbenv-vars` file, as if you put it in the same folder of your decidim generated application, and if you use a version control system (like `git`, which we strongly recommend), then you should ignore this file (ie with the `.gitignore` file).

== 2. Initializing your app for local development

We should now create your database:

[source,bash]
----
bin/rails db:create db:migrate
----

== 3. Filling the database with default data (seed)

If you are not working on a production environment, you can create some default data so you can start testing the app.
[source,bash]
----
bin/rails db:seed
----

The user accounts that you will have in the seeds are:
 * To use an administrator account, use email admin@example.org and password `decidim123456`.
 * To participate as a regular user, with email `user@example.org` and password `decidim123456`.
 * To manage the Multitenant and being able to log in at `/system`, with email `system@example.org` and password `decidim123456`.

If you are working on a production environment and you still want to use some default data (for instance, for a Demo or Staging server), run:

[source,bash]
----
SEED=true rails db:seed
----


== 4. Start your web server

You can now start your server!

[source,bash]
----
bin/rails s
----

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see your app running. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
